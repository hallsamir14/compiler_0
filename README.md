## **Lexical Analyzer**

Lexical analysis is the first layer of compilation and involves breaking down the input source code into a sequence of tokens for further processing by a compiler or interpreter. The primary goal of lexical   analysis is to simplify the code by converting it from a stream of characters into a stream of meaningful tokens.
A lexeme is the smallest unit of a programming language that has some meaning. It is the actual sequence of characters in the source code that represents a particular element in the language, such as a variable name, keyword, number, or symbol.
A token is a categorized or classified lexeme. It is a data structure that consists of two components: the token's type (also known as the token's name or category) and an optional attribute value (the actual value of the lexeme).

### Key components include:
- Source code (text or text file)
- Tokenization
- Handling whitespace and comments
- Error handling
- Symbol tables
